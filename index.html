    <h1>Basic Mechanics of Sound</h1>
    <p>In order to understand the synthesizer, we first have to understand exactly how sound works.  Sound is essentially the travel of energy from one thing to our ears.  When a sound occurs, such as a foot stepping on the ground, the ground vibrates and pushes the air molecules around it.  This starts off a chain reaction of vibrating air molecules, all the way until they reach the ears of those around the footstep.  This same principle can be applied to musical instruments as well.  When a guitar string is plucked, it vibrates, giving off a specific sound that reverberates the air molecules around it.  So this is how sound works, but how does it change? Why do sounds sound different? This is due to the frequency and the amplitude of the sound wave.  The frequency is the amount of vibrations per second in the wave, and the amplitude is the total energy of the wave, which affects the volume of the final sound.  </p>

    <h1>Musical Mechanics of Sound</h1>
    <p>The type of sound one hears from a musical instrument is mainly due to the wave length that the instrument produces.  There are four main types of waves: the sine wave, the square wave, the saw-tooth wave, and the triangle wave.  You can hear the difference between all of these wave in the video embedded below.  All of them produce a unique, distinctive sound that gives them character.  These waves are also unique in the fact that they are longitudinal waves.  Longitudinal waves are vibrate in a direction that is parallel to its origin.  This is different than normal vertical waves.  The wave is how the instrument gets its base unique sound - but then, in order to play actual music, the instrument has to be able to produce different sounds, while still remaining in the same wave form category as the original.  This is done by changing the frequency and the amplitude, as mentioned before.  For example, in a guitar, to change the frequency of a note, the player will put their finger over a fret and shorten the length of the string playing, which increases the frequency of the note.  This makes the sound wave vibrate at a higher hz.  1 Hz means the wave vibrates one time per second.  To increase the amplitude, the player strums with more force, and to decrease the amplitude, they strum with less force.  </p>

    <h1>Basics of Synthesizers</h1>
    <p>Synthesizers basically do exactly what a normal instrument does.  It produces a distinct wave, can change frequency, and can adjust the volume of the sound.  What sets the synth apart from everything else is that it can produce any wave of any shape, generate more than one sound tone at the same time, and change the volume of the sound over time on a whim.  This is done using 4 things.  First, is the oscillator.  The oscillator creates the initial sound and the wave form.  It’s the building block of the synthesizer that all of the other components act on.  Next is the envelope.  It constantly “envelopes” the sound coming from the oscillator in order to shape it under the parameters of attack, decay, sustain, and release.  There is also the LFO, the low frequency oscillator.  This is an oscillator which emits a very low frequency that the human ear can usually not hear.  We don’t actually hear the LFO, but we use the oscillation to control other sounds made on the synthesizer.  The envelope can act in different methods, such as in frequency or amplitude.  Attack increases, decay decreases, sustain keeps the sound at the same spot, and release ends the sound.  The filter is able to filter out certain frequencies of sound.  For example, if there are two people speaking and one has a low pitched voice and one has a high pitched voice, we can use the filter to either filter out the low pitched voice or the high pitched voice.  This is used a lot in music production and is called the “Hi-Pass/Lo-Pass” filter.  There is also timbre.  Timbre is the characteristic of the sound.  Two sounds can have the exact same wavelength, but a different timbre, and sound completely different.  And finally we have the amplifier.  The amplifier is basic, and just changes the volume of the sound by manipulating the amplitude of the wave.</p>

    <h1>The Analog Synthesizer</h1>
    <p>There are two main versions of synthesizers in the world today.  The first is the analog synthesizer.  The analog synthesizer is the classic, producing its sound authentically through the inside of its components.  One of the most iconic synths is the Moog, made by the company R.A. Moog Co.  It consists of a board overlooking a keyboard.  Because of its size, there are many different oscillators, filters, envelopes, lfos, and amplifiers.  This makes it capable of producing incredibly complex sounds.  In fact, the customizing of the sounds themselves and being able to do it on the fly was a very important part of bands who performed live using synthesizers.  In this video: the band Yellow Magic Orchestra, a 1970’s Japanese synth pop band who are widely considered to be one of the best synth bands of all time performs live.  All of the keyboard players are playing on basic keyboards, which makes it look like there is nothing technical happening.  But in fact, behind them, the lead band member Haruomi Hosono is controlling all of the members sounds on a gigantic synthesizer.  The size of it can only be given justice by the video.  In the performance, he is constantly changing wave lengths, frequencies, envelopes, etc. in order to make the most cohesive performance possible.  This is the best example of the analog synthesizer and its true power.  The band can switch to different sounds on the fly with just a plug being inserted into a receiver.

    <h1>The Digital Synthesizer</h1>
    <p>The digital synthesizer works in the same principle as the analog synthesizer, but instead of using analog signals, they use digital ones.  They produce a complex stream of numbers which are then converted to the analog signals that we are familiar with through drivers.  These analog signals then produce sounds like the synthesizer.  A digital synthesizer is essentially a computer with a screen and a keyboard attached to it.  There are also many “micro-synth” programs available on music editing softwares today.  These allow the user to utilize the synth, but instead of having an actual keyboard, they can just play the notes one by one with their mouse and streamline them into a song.  This method uses the same principle as digital synthesizers in a less obvious environment.

    <h1>The Sampler</h1>
    <p>Building on digital synthesizers, there are also samplers.  Samplers are very simple to in theory and in practice, but are responsible for lots of incredible music.  A sampler essentially records any sound at all and stores it in the memory of the machine.  Then, the user can operate it and manipulate the “sample” similar to how users can manipulate synthesizers.  They can slow it down, speed it up, pitch it down, pitch it up, cut it up, etc.  The possibilities are endless.  Famous examples of the sampler include Kanye West pitching up soul samples, such as Chaka Khan’s “Through the Fire” on his song “Through the Wire.”

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>The synthesizer is possibly the biggest collaboration between science and art that the world has ever seen.  The genius invention of one man has gone on to completely reshape the music industry and its artists.  It is hard now to find a song that does not have a synth somewhere within it.  On top of that, the synth has lead to other music technology that has reshaped how we listen such as auto-tune.  The synthesizer has also reduced the barrier of entry to music profoundly.  Now, anyone who wants to create music does not have to know how to play or have access to thousands of complex instruments.  They can simply download a free program on their computer and let their ideas flourish. </p>
